### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You can call me Zero or Z for short. I am new to programming and want to learn as much as I can. 
I'm looking for tutelage from any experienced programmer.
I'm currently working on a mobile app for truckers. I have most of the HTML, and CSS worked out, but I still need to add PHP, and a little javascript.
Please feel free to contact me via email, flowerdookee@gmail.com
I am currently trying to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MYSQL.
I have a loooong way to go and could use some expertise. Thank you.
